# BlogApp-vue
BlogApp  using vue and Django
This webapp uses vue as frontend and Django as backend.
*[Vue] (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, 
Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. 
The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
*[Django] is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers,
it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, 
so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.
